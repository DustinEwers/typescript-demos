This talk contains code samples and slides for the Taming the JavaScript Dragon with TypeScript talk. 

There are two different projects. The first, tsDemos, is a ASP.NET MVC project that contains the slides and a basic demo game (like Kingdom of Loathing). The second project ts-node-demo, is actually a copy of Microsoft's TypeScript node.js demo from the VSCode website.
